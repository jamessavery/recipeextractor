## Premise
<b><u>[cooked.wiki](https://cooked.wiki/)</u></b> is used to summarise recipes on the net by adding "cooked.wiki/" to the start of recipe URLs.

This action is laborious on mobile devices - the premise here is to conveniently parse the most recent item on a users' clipboard, and open it on their browser.

This is a non-profit tool which uses cooked.wiki to do the heavy lifting.
